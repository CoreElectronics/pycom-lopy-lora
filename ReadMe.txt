# pycom-lopy-lora-example

This project is documented on the Core Electronics web site at: https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/pycom-lopy-lora-example.html

The code is broken into "phases" to make it easier to follow changes from the simplest implementation (Phase 0) to a fully-featured version (Phase 5).
